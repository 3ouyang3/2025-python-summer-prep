# Instructions for setting up your fork & submitting the HW

1. ✅ **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
    * Make sure it's synced to OUR main branch.
3. 🌿 In your fork, **Create a new branch** name it `week{x}`. Replace `{x}` with the current week. Example: `week2`.
   * Make sure it's synced to YOUR main branch.
4. 💻 **Open a Codespace** from your forked repository on the *main* branch.
5. In the Codespace terminal, type `git status` to confirm which branch you're on.
    * 🔀 **Navigate to your new branch** with `git checkout {branch}`.
6. ⚠️ **Don’t edit the original exercise file** directly.  
    * 📄➡️ Instead, copy it, rename it with your initials: `HM_week2_hw.ipynb`, place your copy into the `homeworks` folder and work on *that*.
7. **Add/Stage JUST your hw file**
    * ⚠️ Beware of adding everything vs adding specific files, we want to avoid merge conflicts!
8. 📝 **Commit your changes** with a message like: *"completed week 2 hw"*.
9. 🚀 **Push your hw file** inside your branch.
    * DO NOT push or merge to your main branch. Leave it untouched.
