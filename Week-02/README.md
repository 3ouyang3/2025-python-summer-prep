# Week 2 of Summer Prep

## Agenda
1. Remind me to start recording
2. Random HW Check
3. Lecture
4. Break
5. *MAYBE* - Install github
6. Exercise 

## HW is to solve all the problems in the Exercise.ipynb file.

# Instructions for setting up your fork & submitting the HW

1. ✅ **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. 🌿 **Create a new branch** name it `week{x}`. Replace `{x}` with the current week. Example: `week2`.
3. 💻 **Open a Codespace** from your forked repository.
4. 🔀 **Navigate to your new branch** with `git checkout {branch}`.
5. 📂 Create a folder named `homeworks` in the *root* of the repo
    * ✍️ **Complete your exercise file** in this folder.
6. ⚠️ **Don’t edit the original exercise file** directly.  
    * 📄➡️ Instead, copy it, rename it with your initials: `HM_week2_hw.ipynb`, and work on *that*.
7. 📝 **Commit your changes** with a message like: *"completed week 2 hw"*.
8. 🚀 **Push your hw file** to your folder inside your branch.
    * ⚠️ Beware of adding everything vs adding specific files, we want to avoid merge conflicts!
